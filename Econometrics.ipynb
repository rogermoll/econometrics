    "1. **Y** is related in a linear way to **x**. This is called the Data Generating Process or DGP: $y_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i + \\varepsilon_i$\n",
    "2. All observations on x are fixed numbers. \n",
    "3. The n errors $\\varepsilon_i$ are random draws from a distribution with mean zero ($E(\\varepsilon^{2}_{i} = 0)$).\n",
    "4. The variance of the n errors is a constant $E(\\varepsilon^{2}_{i} = \\sigma^2)$, which means that all observations are equally informative about the underlying DGP. This assumption is usually called homoskedasticity, meaning something like 'equal stretching'.\n",
    "5. the error terms are not correlated $E(\\varepsilon_{i} \\varepsilon_{j}) = 0$ for all i$\\neq$j.\n",
    "6. the unknown coefficients alpha and beta are the same for all n observations, and thus there is only a single straight line to fit to the scatter of the data.\n",
    "7. the errors epsilon are jointly, normally and identically distributed $E \\sim NID(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these seven assumptions, we can determine the precise statistical properties of the slope estimator b. And in particular we can find expressions for its mean value and its variance. \n",

    "* $b = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i(y_i - \\overline{y})}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i(x_i - \\overline{x})}}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The seven assumptions imply that b has a normal distribution with mean beta and variance sigma b squared. This distribution can be standardized to give the Z-score, which is distributed as standard normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $b \\sim N(\\beta, \\sigma^{2}_{b} and Z = \\frac{b-\\beta}{\\sigma_{b} \\sim N(0,1)})$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The t value is defined as b minus beta divided by the standard deviation of b. When n is large enough, the t-distribution is approximately the same as the standard normal distribution. As a rule of thumb, we reject the null hypothesis that beta is 0 when the absolute t value is larger than 2. The approximate 95% confidence interval of the standard normal distribution is the interval -2 to 2.  \n",
    "    * $t_{b} = \\frac{b-\\beta}{s_{b} \\sim t(n-2)}$\n",
    "    * t-test on $H_{0}: \\beta = 0 based on t_{b} = \\frac{b}{s_{b}}$  \n",
    "      Rule of thumb for large n: reject $H_{0}$ if $t_{b} < -2$ or $t_{b} < +2$\n",
